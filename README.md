Welcome to Recipys, the project of two CS students and friends who enjoy cooking!

This project is on github and is hosted by readthedocs.org.

If you have suggestions for a recipie and are familiar with git, use the template to get started.

If you are unfamiliar with git, feel free to open an issue on the issue tracker with the details of the recipe and one of us will add it to the repo.

Also feel free to make note of any typographical errors, dead links or suggestions for existing recipes!

Enjoy!
