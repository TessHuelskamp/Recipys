Garlic Basil Chicken
====================

Ingredients
-----------

* 1lb Boneless chicken breasts
* 1/4 cup oil
* 5-6 Roma tomatoes (or 3 greenhouse, if you don't have romas)
* 6 Cloves of garlic
* 2 Handfuls of basil, cut into ribbons
* 2 Zucchinis, sliced
* 1/4 cup Butter

Instructions
------------

#. Prep tomatoes, basil and garlic and set aside.
#. Heat the oil in a heavy pan over medium heat. Once hot, add chicken and pan fry until done (6-10 minutes).
   Leave covered for the first 4 minutes, then allow excess water to simmer off.
#. Once the chicken is done, set it aside. Do not drain the pan.
#. IN THE SAME PAN, with the same oil and everything, add tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and cook until they've broken down to a saucelike mixture.
#. Add garlic to the sauce and continue to simmer.
#. In a second pan, melt half the butter and add zucchini. Salt and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat, turning frequently, for 4 minutes.
#. Add basil and chicken to sauce mixture. Simmer for 2 minutes.
#. Place zucchini on plate, serve chicken and sauce on top.

Serves: 2

Notes
-----

* It's recommended to pound the chicken to an even thickness to allow it to cook completely evenly--I've found this isn't wholly necessary.
* Ease off on the lemon pepper maybe?
