Fried Squash Bloosoms 
==========================

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 salted anchovies, cleaned, filleted, and halved lengthwise and cross wise 
* 4 oz. mozzarella, cut into 12 equal pieces ( if you happen to take a bite of one, be certain to trim the others to solve the probem your hungry maw created) 
* 12 squash blossoms, cleaned, dried, stamen removed, and stem trimmed to about 1 inch ( "about" does not mean 2 inches are fine, for this instance alone we must be size queens and make it as close to 1 inch as possible)
* Neutral oil for frying ( rapeseed, peanut, canola, corn) 
* 2 cups all purpose flour (because who really has anything else besides this and bisquick in their cupboards) 
* Pinch of sea salt ( really about a teaspoon should be fine)
* 2 2/3 sparkling ice water ( cause we fancy tonight) 

Instructions
------------

#. Place one piece of anchovy and one piece of mozzarella inside each squash blossom, and set aside (try not to tear the petals for us won't you lovie) 
#. In a medium sized frying pan, heat 2 inches of oil to 350F
#. Fill a large bowl with ice water and rest a second medium bowl inside ( this is not the sparkling ice water)
#. In the medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sparkling water and whick until smooth-making sure to keep the batter as cold as possible between batches
#. One at a time, hold the blossom tips closed and dip into batter, making sure to coat thoroughly
#. Allow extra batter to drip off- making sure that blossom tips are battered shut ( we dont want them exploding in the pan) 
#. Lower blossoms into hot oil, frying until lightly browned ( about 2-3 minutes, turn them once during that time) 

Serves: 4 - 6

Notes
-----
* Make sure to fully close the blossom tips so that they hold together duirng frying
