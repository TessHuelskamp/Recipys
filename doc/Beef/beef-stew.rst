Beef Stew
=========

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 1/2 pounds beef, cut into 2 inch cubes
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* 2 tbs unsalted butter
* 2 medium onions, cut into 6ths
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 tbs tomato paste
* 1/3 cup flour, or to cover
* 10 cups beef/chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned
* 6 sprigs parsley
* 6 sprigs fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 1/4 pounds medium red tomatos
* 4 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
* 2 celery stalks, cut into 2 inch pieces
* 7 canned whole, peeled tomatos, lightly crushed
* 2-3 tbs red wine vinegar, or to taste

Instructions
------------

#. Get a large plastic bag and load the cubed beef in. Coat with flour and shake until all the beef has a nice coating.

#. Add oil to a heavy pan to cover the bottom. Heat to medium-hi, add beef. Cook until browned (approx. 8 minutes).

#. Set the beef aside, clear out the pan (or use another). Melt the butter over medium-hi heat and add onions. Cook until lightly browned (5min).

#. Preheat oven to 325 (f)

#. Take a large pot and add the broth--bring to a simmer while doing the other steps.

#. Add garlic to pan and cook until fragrant (approx. 1 min)

#. Add tomato paste to pan and cook until lightly browned (approx. 1 min)

#. Add the beef to pan, cook while stirring until lightly toasted.

#. Dump pan and contents into the now simmering broth in the large pot.

#. Tie the paarsley, thyme and bay leaves together with kitchen twine and add the bundle to the pot.

#. Season with salt to taste.

#. Transfer to oven for 1.5 hours.

#. Remove pot from oven. DO NOT STIR THE CONTENTS. Use a ladel or large spoon to skim off the fat from cooking liquid. Discard the fat.

#. Add carrots, potatos, celery and tomatos to the pot

#. Cook uncovered on the stovetop, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens and vegetables are tender (1 hr).

#. Remove and discard the herbs. Stir in the red wine vinegar, if desired, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serves: 12

Notes
-----
* It actually doesn't take very much tomato paste, don't go over 4 tbs
* Your stew-pot should be oven safe.
* Recommended to be served with sourdough bread and a sharp cheddar chease.
