Sweet and Sticky Honey Soy Sauce Chicken Strips
===============================================

Serves 3-4

Takes ~45 minutes

Ingredients
-----------

For the chicken strips:

* 2 pounds (910g) boneless skinless chicken breast or chicken tenderloins
* 1 cup (240ml) panko bread crumbs (or regular bread crumbs)
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 cup (100g) all-purpose flour, or more if needed
* 1 teaspoon (5ml) kosher salt
* fresh cracked black pepper to taste

For the sweet and sticky honey soy sauce:

* 1/2 cup (120ml) ketchup
* 1/2 cup (120ml) honey <--I ended up adding 3/4 cup of honey.
* 1/4 cup (60ml) soy sauce (or fish sauce cause it tastes better! Fish sauce will be saltier, stat
  with 2-3 tablespoons)
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) chili garlic sauce or any hot sauce (optional)
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) fresh lime juice
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) rice vinegar

Instructions
------------

#. Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare 1-2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
#. If using chicken breasts, cut into thin strips. The thicker they are, the longer they take to cook.
#. Make sure the strips are consistently sized so that you get even baking.
#. In a bowl, add panko or bread crumbs. In another bowl, beat the eggs. In medium bowl combine flour,
   salt and black pepper.
#. Dredge each strip of chicken in flour, then egg, then Panko or bread crumbs. Lay coated chicken
   strips on sheet pan. Repeat for all chicken strips.
#. Bake chicken strips in oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and crisp.
#. Remember to turn the chicken strips about 1/2 way through cooking.
#. While the chicken is baking, make the sauce. In bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients: ketchup,
   honey, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, fresh lime juice and rice vinegar.
#. When chicken is finished baking, set aside.
#. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of the chicken strips and half of the sauce. Toss
   to coat and cook for about 30 seconds on each side or until the chicken strips soak up the 
   sauce on both sides and become sticky. Repeat with remainder of sauce and chicken strips. 
   *(Cooking Tip: Don't let the pan get too hot because if the pan becomes too hot, 
   it dries up the sauce and becomes too sticky.)*
