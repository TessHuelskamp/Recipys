#. Cook the spinach on a medium heat in a splash of oil for 3-5 minutes until it is slightly wilted.
#. Stir in the ricotta and cook for a further 30-60 seconds. Allow to cool.
#. Cut slits into the chicken breasts about 1cm apart but don’t cut all the way through - about 75%

   has melted and the juices are clear.
