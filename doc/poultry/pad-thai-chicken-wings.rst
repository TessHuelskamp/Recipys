Pad Thai Chicken Wings
======================

Ingredients
-----------

* 15 (about 2 lbs) chicken wings, drumettes and wingettes separated
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce
* 3 tbsp tamarind concentrate
* 1/4 cup Thai sweet chili sauce
* 3 tbsp sriracha
* 1/3 cup palm sugar
* 2 tbsp salted peanuts, roughly chopped
* 1 tbsp garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp chives, chopped
* 1 tbsp cilantro, chopped
* Oil for deep frying

Instructions
------------

* First make the sauce: In a saucepan on medium heat, add tamarind concentrate, palm sugar, Sriracha,
  Thai chili sauce, and fish sauce to the saucepan. Whisk well to combine. Turn off the heat once the
  sauce has thickened and reduced. Set aside.

* Heat oil in a wok to 350°F. Pat dry chicken wings. Coat in flour and shake off the excess.

* These wings are double fried, so you will need to work in several batches, depending on the size of
  your wok or fryer. Carefully place each wing piece in the oil. Remove first batch after 6-8
  minutes, when they are slightly golden brown. Allow oil to heat back up to 350°F before frying the
  next batch. Remove and let the wings rest for about 5 minutes. Heat the oil up to 380°F and fry the
  wings for a second time, until they are crispy and golden. Rest wings on a wire rack.

* Using a fine mesh strainer, fry minced garlic in the hot oil for a few minutes, until crispy and
  golden brown. Set aside to drain on paper towel. Prepare the topping by mixing the peanuts,
  cilantro, and chives.

* In a large bowl, toss wings in the sauce with half of the topping mixture. Serve on a platter and
  sprinkle the remaining half of the toppings.
